But lately I have been exploring an alternative: quantiles (e.g. deciles, percentiles, etc). Viewing data in this way has several advantages to histograms, including robustness to outliers and a freedom from apriori assumptions about the range or smoothing level of the data.</span></a></article></li>

And for most scientists, it’s simply not interesting using all these build tools when you just want to get coding quickly on a new machine.</span></a></article></li>

Like all languages, Clojure has some warts. But it also has a lot of very powerful and abstract concepts that many average programmers have not seen before, and like most mathematical concepts, the power of such abstractions are greatly underestimated by many people. Even fancy-sounding but easy-to-understand concepts like homoiconicity are still really underappreciated in the programming community.</span></a></article></li>

My hope is that seeing some of the successes and failures I encountered will help you build your own composite robots. Foam and fiberglass are very versatile materials that are just as accessible to garage-level workshops as they are to research institutions, as I hope you will see.</span></a></article></li>

Depending on what you will do with the data, you can either represent it in tabular form (as a vector of vectors), or as a list of hashmaps. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and here are some very stock functions for how to achieve that:</span></a></article></li>

PostgreSQL) in a Docker container, create a Postgres database, and connect to it from a Clojure REPL. Postgres is a great open source SQL database with a long history, and is a good choice for many small-to-medium scale projects.</span></a></article></li>

I still don’t have a good vocabulary for describing why I think these things are neat, except to say that I somehow find it relaxing to work on toy engineering problems once or twice a month. I guess de gustibus non est disputandum – “there’s no accounting for (bad) taste!”</span></a></article></li>

It is essentially two concentric domes, one nested inside the other, connected entirely by tetrahedra in a way that both strengthens the dome and provides space for insulation. Compared to single-layer geodesic structures, this new structure uses about 2-3x more materials, but it is so much stronger that it is startling.</span></a></article></li>

It lasted until last year, when I finally grew tired of upgrading applications, keeping comments free of spam, and the servers secure from hackers and the occasional website defacement. Thank you, GitHub, for providing this terrible sysadmin a free place to store this content, and one that requires no regular maintanance!</span></a></article></li>

The only code that needs to be changed is the neighbors function neigh and the estimated cost-to-goal function est. Everything else can be reused from problem 81.(defn euler-83 []  (let [mat   (load-matrix &quot;/zzz/work/matrix.txt&quot;)        m     (count mat)        n     (count (first mat))        cost  (fn [[i j]] (nth (nth mat (dec i)) (dec j)))        start [1 1]        goal  [m n]        goal?

Continued fractions are really quite remarkable; have you ever wondered why some rational fractions (e.g. 1/3) take infinitely many decimals to represent (0.3333…), while other fractions (e.g. 1/4) have a finite representation (0.25)?

Side effects! Square roots!? What have I done?! Functional Puritans out there, you may want to shield your children’s eyes!</span></a></article></li>

  <li><article><a href="/project-euler/problem-08/">Project Euler Problem 8 <span class="entry-date"><time datetime="2010-06-07T07:12:20-07:00">June 07, 2010</time></span> <span class="excerpt">The definition of Problem 8  suggests some flexibility on how you treat the 1000-digit number: as a number or as a string. I decided that it would be easier to understand as the latter – using mod to extract digits seemed a little redundant and not really the point of the problem, which treats each digit as a distinct object. Why make things more complex than they need to be?</span></a></article></li>

To make this problem a bit harder, I decided that the function which will generate prime numbers must be lazy, or at least appear so to the consumer.</span></a></article></li>

Everyone’s solution seemed similar to my own, with some minor stylistic variation.(def natural-numbers (iterate inc 1))</span></a></article></li>

My first try at the problem resulted in a slow but working implementation.(defn multiple-of-all? [n factors]  (every? #(zero? (rem n %)) factors))</span></a></article></li>

I’ll post my notes here as I go along for everyone to enjoy, critique, or just laugh at.</span></a></article></li>
