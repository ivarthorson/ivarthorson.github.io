It lasted until last year, when I finally grew tired of upgrading applications, keeping comments free of spam, and the servers secure from hackers and the occasional website defacement. Thank you, GitHub, for providing this terrible sysadmin a free place to store this content, and one that requires no regular maintanance!"
